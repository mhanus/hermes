About Hermes
============

Hermes is a free C++ library for rapid development of
adaptive *hp*-FEM and *hp*-DG solvers for partial differential equations (PDE)
and multiphysics PDE systems. The development team includes the 
`hp-FEM group <http://hpfem.org/>`_ at the `University of Nevada, Reno <http://www.unr.edu>`_ 
and their `collaborators <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes.git/blob/HEAD:/AUTHORS>`_ 
from numerous places around the globe.

A standard way to use Hermes is to write short C++ user programs 
that use the functionality provided by the library, but for 
those who prefer to use a graphical interface, the group located at the 
University of West Bohemia develops a graphical Engineering tool based on Hermes2D: 
`Agros2D <http://hpfem.org/agros2d/>`_.
